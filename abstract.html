								<h2>The
									ACM-CUNY Celebrates Women in Computing 2021 is soliciting abstracts for the Contributed Paper
									and Poster Sessions, as well as panel session, workshop, and demo at its 2021 conference on Friday, May 7, 2021.</h2>

									<h3>Computing in a Covid World</h3>

								<p>The Covid pandemic has forced changes on a global level both socially and
									economically. The STEM industries have been
									greatly impacted by these changes and have had to cope with a new Covid world.
									During this challenging time, the STEM
									industries have been in the forefront of new medical breakthroughs such as Covid
									testing and vaccines and engineering
									innovations in the areas of protective medical gear and medical equipment such as
									respirators. In terms of information
									technology, there has been a shift away from local technologies to Internet
									technologies which promote user friendly and
									effective methods and tools for sharing information, communicating, learning and
									conducting business. This shift in the
									traditional roles STEM has played in society, has produced successes and
									challenges. You are invited to submit papers,
									posters, panels etc. related to the theme of “Computing in a Covid World.”
									Suggested topics include but not limited to:

								</p>

								<p> • Computing in pre and post Covid World </p>
								<p> • The role of technology during the pandemic </p>
								<p> • The role of data in today’s world </p>
								<p> • What the pandemic has taught us about social justices (or injustices) </p>
								<p> • Reshaping computer science education to embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion
								</p>
								<p> • Ethics and social issues relating to technology.</p>

								<h3>Submitting abstracts</h3>
								<p>All interested students and professionals in academia and industry are encouraged
									to submit an abstract. The Contributed
									Paper Sessions will feature presentations on computing education and research, as
									well as diversity initiatives. The Poster
									or Demo Sessions will be a good venue for students to showcase their computing
									related projects. Students are also encouraged
									to submit an abstract to one of the Talks.</p>

								<p>The CUNYCWiC aims to encourage the engagement and the participation of all students
									and faculty in a wide range of computer science
									related research and projects and to provide networking opportunities and
									explorations of careers in computing.</p>
