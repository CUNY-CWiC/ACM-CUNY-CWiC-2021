										<h2>This year's theme is "Computing in a Covid World."</h2>

										<p>The Covid pandemic has forced changes on a global level both socially and
											economically. The STEM industries have been
											greatly impacted by these changes and have had to cope with a new Covid world.
											During this challenging time, the STEM
											industries have been in the forefront of new medical breakthroughs such as Covid
											testing and vaccines and engineering
											innovations in the areas of protective medical gear and medical equipment such as
											respirators. In terms of information
											technology, there has been a shift away from local technologies to Internet
											technologies which promote user friendly and
											effective methods and tools for sharing information, communicating, learning and
											conducting business. This shift in the
											traditional roles STEM has played in society, has produced successes and
											challenges. You are invited to submit papers,
											posters, panels etc. related to the theme of “Computing in a Covid World.”
											Suggested topics include but not limited to:

										</p>

										<p> • Computing in pre and post Covid World </p>
										<p> • The role of technology during the pandemic </p>
										<p> • The role of data in today’s world </p>
										<p> • What the pandemic has taught us about social justices (or injustices) </p>
										<p> • Reshaping computer science education to embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion
										</p>
										<p> • Ethics and social issues relating to technology.</p>

										<h3>Submitting abstracts</h3>
										<p>All interested students and professionals in academia and industry are encouraged
											to submit an abstract. The Contributed
											Paper Sessions will feature presentations on computing education and research, as
											well as diversity initiatives. The Poster
											or Demo Sessions will be a good venue for students to showcase their computing
											related projects. Students are also encouraged
											to submit an abstract to one of the Talks.</p>

										<p>The CUNYCWiC aims to encourage the engagement and the participation of all students
											and faculty in a wide range of computer science
											related research and projects and to provide networking opportunities and
											explorations of careers in computing.</p>
