											<h3>Morning Keynote Presenter</h3>

											<p>We are pleased to have Sarah Knepper, Software Engineer Manager, Intel, as the morning keynote presenter 
												for our CUNYCWiC 2021 conference.</p>

											<div class = "keyImg">
												<img src = assets/css/images/keynoteImage.png>
											</div>
											<p>Sarah Knepper is a manager on the Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) team. oneMKL is the 
												fastest and most-used math library for Intel®-based systems, enabling developers to create performant 
												science, engineering, and financial applications. Previously she was a software engineer for oneMKL, developing 
												and optimizing dense linear algebra functionality. Sarah has also worked on a number of other libraries at Intel, 
												including the Intel® oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library, the Intel® Autonomous Driving Library, and the UPM sensor 
												library.</p>
												

											<p>Sarah earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science (and Theatre) from the College of Saint Benedict and a PhD in 
												Computer Science from Emory University. She participated in two internships at Sandia National Laboratories, where 
												she experienced the value of cross-disciplinary teams to bring diverse viewpoints. Sarah serves on the SIAM (Society 
												for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) Industry Committee and is a SIAM Visiting Lecturer. She is passionate about diversity 
												and inclusion, constantly seeking opportunities to create a more inclusive culture.</p>

											<p>Sarah lives near Portland, Oregon with her fiancé and their cat, where she enjoys the local farmers markets and natural beauty 
												of the Pacific Northwest. With all of the extra time at home due to the pandemic, she has begun learning to play the violin.</p>

												
											<h3>Afternoon Keynote Presenter</h3>

											<p>We are pleased to have Dr. Brian Chen from Lehigh University, as the afternoon keynote presenter 
												for our CUNYCWiC 2021 conference.</p>

											<div class = "keyImg">
												<img src = assets/css/images/BrianChen.jpeg>
											</div>
											<p>Dr. Brian Y. Chen is a structural bioinformatician who develops techniques in computational geometry, structural biology, 
												and machine learning to create software that can predict and explain the mechanisms of binding specificity in proteins.  
												He is especially motivated by the potential to achieve scientific insights through computation, statistical inference, 
												and collaboration with experimentalists.  A recent result in Dr. Chen's lab, in collaboration with plant pathologists 
												at Rutgers university, was the use of his software to discover new amino acids that are crucial for the toxicity mechanism in ricin.  
												At Lehigh, he has taught quite a few courses, ranging from introductory courses in programming to courses in genomics, 
												structural bioinformatics, and computer graphics.</p>
												
											<p>Dr. Chen earned his Ph.D. from Rice University's Department of Computer Science for his work on protein function annotation. 
												His advisor was Dr. Lydia Kavraki. While at Rice, he had the opportunity to learn quite a bit about structural bioinformatics, 
												robotics, graphics, and distributed systems. He received a B.A. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Computer Science from 
												Rutgers University, in 2000.</p>
