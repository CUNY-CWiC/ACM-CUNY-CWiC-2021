							<h2>Supporting, Celebrating and Advocating for Women in Computing</h2>

							<h3>ACM-W COUNCIL ON WOMEN IN COMPUTING</h3>

							<h4>Mission Statement</h4>

							<p>ACM-W supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women 
								in all aspects of the computing field, providing a wide range of programs and services to 
								ACM members and working in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women. 
								<a href="https://women.acm.org" target="_blank">View ACM-W</a>
							</p>

							<p>One of the most popular ways to celebrate women in computing is by starting and/or attending an ACM-W 
								Celebration of Women in Computing; the accomplishments of women in computing are at the heart of ACM-W’s e-Newsletter.
							</p>

							<h4>Celebrations of Women in Computing</h4>

							<p>
								ACM Celebrations of Women in Computing connect technical women who are working/studying within a particular geographical 
								location – with locations that could be a single city, a state or group of states, a country, or several countries. These 
								conferences build community and break down feelings of isolation. Our intention is to reach the broadest possible populations 
								through an international network of self-sustaining small conferences, dovetailing when possible with ACM-W chapters. 
								<a href="https://women.acm.org/celebrations" target="_blank">View ACM-W Celebrations</a>
							</p>

							<p>
								Imagine yourself surrounded by 200 computer science students, all ready to network and share their experiences! Our ACM Celebrations 
								of Women in Computing showcase women involved in the computing industry and computer science research, encourage mentoring and networking, 
								include career fairs and panel sessions, and create opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to present their research and projects 
								through poster competitions and presentations. More than 30 celebrations throughout the US and the world inspire women to excel in their chosen 
								field--find one near you or start a new one!
							</p>
